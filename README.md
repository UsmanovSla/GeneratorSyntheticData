## Synthetic Data Generation for AI-Driven Optimization of Con-struction Machinery Assemblies

In current practice, the deployment of AI models for the optimization of construction processes is highly complex and limited, primarily due to the lack of data available for training AI models. Collecting real-world data is a time- and resource-intensive process. In this article, the author focuses on the development of a methodology and a model for generating synthetic data intended for the subsequent training of AI models aimed at optimizing construction machine assemblies. The generation of synthetic data, based on a sophisticated simulation process, employs queuing theory and the stochastic Monte Carlo method. The proposed approach enables the rapid generation of large-scale syn-thetic datasets. The developed model and generator are specifically focused on the use of construction machinery in earthworks. Selected generated data were compared with and validated against real construction projects.
